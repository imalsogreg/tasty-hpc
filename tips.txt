<imalsogreg> chrisdone: Tangentially related to both lucid and hindent, I tried for a while to find a way to turn haskell-src-exts adt into html, with a div for each node and class set to the node's constructor

<imalsogreg> chrisdone: Yah. The intention was to make a test report using tasty. Tasty would mark up the adt to show you invidivual tests' coverage.

<biscarch> bitonic: nope. There have just been some things taking up maintainers time (such as moving countries). The 1.0 will use io-streams and the 0.14 was an intermediary release that was fairly recent.

<imalsogreg> chrisdone: But I quickly ended up falling into something that looked like I'd be writing every constructor's case by hand.

<chrisdone> imalsogreg: seems like you need a way to handle things like operators and strings that would contain < and >
<chrisdone> imalsogreg: maybe you could have an Extender for QOp and for Lit to escape them
<imalsogreg> chrisdone: Oh, you mean escaping those? Yah
<newcomer> For some reason the following code waits for input before printing "Enter a string: ". After getting input from user it prints "Enter a string: ". http://lpaste.net/114877
<chrisdone> imalsogreg: and then just have a catch all extender for the rest of node types to wrap them up
<chrisdone> imalsogreg: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hindent-3.9.1/docs/HIndent-Types.html#v:CatchAll
<Hijiri> newcomer: it's because of output bufferig
<Hijiri> if you use a terminal this is an issue for most languages
<Hijiri> call hFlush stdout manually after you have what you want to print buffered
* Nervkind has quit (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
<Hijiri> Alternatively, you can set buffering mode to NoBuffering
<imalsogreg> chrisdone: Ooh
<Hijiri> but no buffering is slower
<haskellquestion> hey guys this is the program you helped me with a ton yesterday. let me know if there are any suggestions/refactorings/improvements i can make. thanks! http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/70674/brainfuck-interpreter-in-haskell-40-lines

<imalsogreg> chrisdone: prettyNoExt a, from the name, it sounds like this doesn't have the extender recursing into a?
* chaosmasttter (~chaosmast@p5B2FEB52.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has joined #haskell
<chrisdone> imalsogreg: it means don't call any extenders for this node, but do so for children of this node
